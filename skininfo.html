<h1>Skin info for Grey_skale 0.1</h1>
<h2>Skin features :</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Xhtml and CSS valid.</li>
  <li>Includes all default containers.</li>
  <li>Includes both Fluid and Fixed (switchable) versions.</li>
  <li>Tested with many browsers and many possible known bugs have been sorted, tried to make the skin cross-browser, and cross-resolution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes: The idea behind this simple skin was accepting the browsers as they are and trying to comply the skin with them this time, instead of making (emulating) them to comply with standarts as much as possible.</p>
<p>This skin is meant to be a basic(skeleton) one, do not expect  much visual. This is an initial release, if you find any bugs or for any recommandation or anything else please report to the official topic in the<a href="http://forums.b2evolution.net"> b2evo forums</a>, <em>All kind of feedback is appreciated.</em></p>
<p>Regards</p>
